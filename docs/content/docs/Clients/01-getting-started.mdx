Reuters graphics can be completely customized to suit the needs of your site and built to host on your servers by editing the source code directly.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a code editor and a compatible version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer. (The minimum version of Node will be specified in the `engines` field in the `package.json` file in the root of the project.)

Unzip the project archive, navigate to the root of the project (where `package.json` lives) in a terminal and then install the project dependencies using a Node package manager like `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm`.

```console
npm install
```

After dependencies are installed, you can start a development server to preview changes as you make them to the project.

```console
npm start
```

Read more about how to make changes to the project's source code by reading the developer docs on this site.
