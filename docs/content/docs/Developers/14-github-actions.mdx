You can use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) from the [Reuters Graphics GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/) to upload and publish updates to your project in the cloud.

Publishing events can be triggered by a regular schedule, by another process like a scraper through an API call or directly from the "Actions" tab on your project's repo. You can run additional scripts before publishing to fetch or verify data or after publishing, to notify a Teams channel or other cleanup.
