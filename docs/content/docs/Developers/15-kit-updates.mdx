The version of the graphics kit a project was started from is specified in the `version` key of the project's `package.json` file.

```json {3}
// package.json
{
  "version": "2.0.0"
}
```

The graphics kit follows [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning, so major updates will get a major point release; minor, a minor; etc.

<Aside>
  If you're used to working with package distribution platforms like npm, the
  graphics kit works a little bit differently because we do not publish or
  maintain _previous_ versions of the kit outside the git history of the
  [bluprint
  repository](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/bluprint_graphics-kit).
</Aside>

You can also consult the [changelog](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/bluprint_graphics-kit/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) in the bluprint repo, which will often include notes on updating previous versions of the kit to get new features in existing projects.
