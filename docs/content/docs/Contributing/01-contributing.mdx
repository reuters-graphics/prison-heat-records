## File an issue

The best way to request new features, flag a bug you've discovered or ask for updates to docs or templates is to [create an issue on the graphics kit repo](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/bluprint_graphics-kit/issues).

Be sure you've searched through open and previously closed issues on the repo to make sure yours hasn't already been addressed.

## Contributing changes

All Reuters graphics staff are welcome to contribute changes to graphics kit code, AI templates and documentation, directly.

<Steps>
1. Make sure you have the latest version of the graphics kit cloned to a local repo on your computer.

2.  Create a new branch for your contribution.

    ```console
    git checkout -b my-new-feature
    ```

3.  Create changes to the kit on your local branch and commit them.

    ```console
    git commit -am "Cool new feature that does something awesome"
    ```

4.  The graphics kit uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/intro-to-using-changesets.md) for versioning and to update our changelog. You should generally make a `patch` changeset unless specifically asked to make a more serious change by one of the project maintainers.

    ```console
    pnpm changeset
    ```

5.  Push your new branch to the repo and create a pull request in GitHub.

        ```console
        git push origin my-new-feature
        ```

</Steps>

### Working with graphics kit docs

Graphics kit documentation is created with the Astro [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) framework.

To work on documentation, run the following command and then edit the appropriate `.mdx` page in the `docs/` directory:

```console
pnpm astro dev
```
