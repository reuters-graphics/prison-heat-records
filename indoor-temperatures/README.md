# Indoor temperature records

Each state folder contains the response received from that state's Department of Corrections.

Reuters requested a spreadsheet or other electronic format documenting daily internal temperature readings for each housing unit in every adult prison, covering the period from December 1, 2023, to December 1, 2024. We also asked for an explanation of how the temperature data was measured and recorded.
The records were submitted in a variety of formats, including spreadsheets and images showing temperatures from internal systems. The records vary in quality.
