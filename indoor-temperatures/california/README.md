**`responses`**: A folder of PDF files in response to Reuters' request for daily internal temperature readings for each housing area in every adult prison operated by the CDCR. Responses sometimes include both indoor and outdoor temperature record data. 

**`output_json`**: An output json file of internally recorded temperatures from June through August 2024. Each PDF page displaying indoor temperature data was uploaded to Gemini 2.5 Pro along with a set of detailed instructions for data extraction. The AI-extracted data was then manually cleaned and merged into a single dataset.
