When talking about Svelte code, please always use Svelte 5 syntax in instructions and code samples unless explicitly asked to use Svelte 4 syntax. Refer to the Svelte llms.txt document at [bin/llms/svelte/llms-small.txt](../bin/llms/svelte/llms-small.txt) in this repo for details on Svelte 5 syntax. Also refer to the SvelteKit llms.txt document at [bin/llms/svelte-kit/llms-small.txt](../bin/llms/svelte-kit/llms-small.txt) in this repo for details on SvelteKit, the framework we use in this repo.

Many components added to projects come from the `@reuters-graphics/graphics-components` library, which is our team's component library including many Svelte components and other utilities. Refer to the graphics components llms.txt document at [bin/llms/graphics-components/llms.txt](../bin/llms/graphics-components/llms.txt) in this repo for details on working with components from that library and especially for examples of our usual conventions for adding graphics components to a page.
