# New York records
 
Unlike other states that reported air conditioning availability in a simple Yes/No format, New York provided data indicating the percentage of each building that is air conditioned.
 
A lower percentage means there are only certain rooms or areas in the building that are air conditioned. Partial air conditioning indicates that there are some, but not all, areas in the building that are air conditioned. There is no blanket interpretation for all buildings, as each building is unique.
 
If a building does not have a corresponding value in the "% Air Cond" column (i.e., the field is blank), that building is not air conditioned.
